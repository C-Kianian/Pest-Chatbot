(47) Photo: John Davidson\nPupal skin of lilac/ash borer protruding from trunk of lilac. (49)\nPhoto: John DavidsonClearwing borers: lilac/ash, banded ash\nSeveral species\nOrder Lepidoptera, Family Sesiidae;\nclearwing borer moths\nNative pests\nHost plants: Alder, ash, birch, dogwood, lilac, hawthorn,\nmountainash, maple, oak, pine, poplar, sycamore,\nviburnum, willow, and fruit trees such as apricot, cherry,\npeach, and plum\nDescription: Adult clearwing borers are wasplike, 12–19\nmm long with long, narrow front wings and shorter,\nwider hind wings. The hind wings, and in some speciesthe front wings, are mostly clear, with a wingspanbetween 26–40 mm. For some species, the two sexeshave different coloring, often yellow, orange or red on\nblack, or dark blue.\nLife history:  Clearwing borers develop through four life\nstages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adults of various\nspecies emerge from spring through summer and depositeggs on bark. The banded ash borer adults emerge inAugust. Adults do not directly damage plants and liveonly for a few days. Larvae mine the sapwood of trees\nduring the summer, pupating the following spring. There\nis usually one generation a year.\nOverwintering: Mature larvae in tunnels under the bark.\nDamage symptoms:  Larval feeding of clearwing borers\ncan cause tree bark to become gnarled or rough, and\ndamage tissue that conducts food and water. With someclearwing borer species, feeding is tolerated by trees andcauses no serious harm. Feeding by other species can\nweaken or kill branches, and may even kill the entire\ntree.\nMonitoring: Ash/lilac borer and lesser peachtree\nborer adults begin to emerge when common lilac and\nVanhoutte spirea bloom in early to mid May. (Herms).Greater peachtree borer adults begin to emerge whenNorthern catalpa blooms in early to mid June. (Herms).\nBanded ash clearwing borer adults begin to emerge in\nlate July (Columbus, Ohio) and in mid August (Wooster,Ohio) (Herms).\nMonitoring and management for all clearwing borers is\nsimilar, since their life cycle is about the same. However,the banded ash clearwing is the exception to the rule; theadults emerge in August rather than May to lay eggs. Look\nfor brown frass around bark cracks and bark wounds.\nLook under loose bark near wounds or cracks for signs oflarval tunneling or empty pupal skins. Display phero-mone, or sex attractant, traps in May to capture adultmale moths. This trapping information can be used totime pesticide applications. Traps and pheromone lures\ncan be obtained from numerous sources. One source is\nGreat Lakes IPM, at www.greatlakesipm.com. Other\nsuppliers include Gempler’s at www.gemplers.comFrass and sawdust caused by lilac/ash clearwing borer larvae.

(42)\nPhoto: John DavidsonCultural control:  Avoid mechanical damage to the bark\nof trees, and minimize tree stress. Do not band trees as it\nhas been shown to increase borer attack.\nChemical control: Spray a long lasting, broad spectrum\ninsecticide on the trunk and limbs of infested trees 10\ndays after the first male is found in a pheromone trap.\nBiological control: Several species of parasitic wasps\nhave been reared from larvae or pupae of the peachtree\nborer. They include Bracon sanninoideae  and\nMacrocentrus marginator  (Braconidae);  Cryptus\nrufovinctus , Phaeogenes ater , and Venturia nigricoxalis\n(Ichneumonidae); Syntomophyrum clisiocampae\n(Eulophidae); and Telenomus quaintacei  (Scelonidae). The\nentomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae ,\ncan control borer larvae if sprayed on frass-surroundedbark cracks in summer. The use of pheromones in amating disruption program maybe an effective control\nfor nurseries but not landscapes.\nPlant mortality risk: High\nLilac/ash clearwing borer adult male.
